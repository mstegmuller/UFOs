# UFOs

Overview

The goal of the analysis was to create a webpage that showed UFO sightings with sortable and filterable data table.   The webpage that needed to be created needed to show date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sighting.  

Results

Someone might use the new webpage by using the filter search.  They have options to filter their UFo search by date, city, state, country, and shape.  This is located on the left side of the page.  The webpage will filter their search by displaying the data they entered in the filter.  

Summary of Analysis

A drawback of the webpage is that it is not as compatible on smaller mobile devices as it is on a laptop.  It is still accessible via these devices but not as efficient as they could be.  If you rotated the screen horizontal it may make the webpage more usable on a mobile device.

A recommendation would be to make the website more mobile device friendly.  Since many people use mobile devices for web browsing this is a change that should be made.  Another recommendation would be to add if an actual alien was seen in the filter search.  That is something that could spark even more interest in UFOâ€™s.
